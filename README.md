# Water-Quality-Meter
Simple project about conductivity of water.

This project is pretty easy and you can customize how you want. For my code i√ç used NUKLEO-F030R8 board which is around 100x more executive than normal arduino uno board. These steps will you help to make project happen:

1. First of all go to www.mbed.com and create your accont. Mbed is online compiler for your Iot projects. In this case we will code in C++ but you can code in C also. 

2. Click compiler and select your board. In my case its NUKLEO-F030R8 but you can choose another board from this series. 

3. Upload code what is uploaded here and add mbed libraries.

4. And thats it! Now you can focus on your design and dont worry about code. In my case i connected three wires. Ground to GND, Power to 3v3 and data pin to A0;

Thanks for your interest,
